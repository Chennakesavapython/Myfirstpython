        -> User will Communicate with a computer using Programming Language

    ->  A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize 
        and structure the implementation of a computer program. 
            -> Imperative, Declarative, Object-Oriented, Functional etc

       -> we use id() to know the addres sof the data  




         24/07/25

  =>Control statements


  ==> conditioal statements
  => conditional statements with output a boolean value is based  on conditional declaration.



  Indentation rules
      => use either space or tabes,but not both(python recommends 4 spaces)

      => make sure all the lines same block,have same indention level

      => input() = predefined function in python that interacts with the user.



    =>    type conversion
        -> it converts one datatype to another datatype
        ->> converting smaller datatype to lager datatype is considered as ssafe operation (Or) ["widening"]
        ->> its automatically handled by python.



        -> converting larger data type to samller datatype is called typecasting.
        ->it is handled by the developer

        -> int() ----> float() etc


        -> ternary operator/ conduional operator





  




     => if
          = > executes when if is true condition
     ,ifelse
     allows to check one or two conditions
     ,elif
     it allows to check multipleconditions statements,
     => matched case(3.1+1)


     => Nested condition = > inside a condition we can write the same condition.



     26/07/25
      -> Loops - Execute a block of code repeatedly, based on
        a condition

        -> When you want to repeat a task you rely on loops

        -> Types Of Loops 

            -> while loop - runs a block of code, as long as 
                the condition is True

            -> for loop - used to Iterate over a sequence
                (strings, lists, tuples etc) 

                -> you can use for loop when you know number
                    of Iterations before hand
            
            -> Nested Loops - Loop inside another loop

    -> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)         

        -> break - stop the execution of loop / terminate  the loop

        -> continue - used to skip the current Iteration

        -> pass - does nothing, used as a placeholder for future code



        =============
        -> variable = 10
        -> multiple values = 10 20 40 incorrect

        ->collection -sequence of data which 

        -> basic collection type is strings
        -> Advanced collection types
        ->lists
        ->tuples
        ->distonaries
        ->>sets

        -> strings



        -->python goes indexing for accessing individual characters.
             ->we have positive indexing(left to right)
             -> we have neagative indexing (right to left)

             0  1  2  3  4  5  (positive)
             p  y  t  h  o  n 
             -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 (negative)


             ->Accessing index out of range causes an error
                    IndexError: string index out of range
    -> Slicing -to access a range of characters inside the string 
       (range) => start,stop,Setup


       slicing - > start.stop,stepup




     -> Stringimmutability
        -> data once created can not be changed.

-> Dictonaries

->In python dictionaries are built in data structure that allows to store multile sets
    of keys & values in a single variable using {} (curly brackets)

-> key value Pairs (item)    
-> it has no indexing no slicing-> no concept ofinex in dictionaries

---> As we use key & values
    
     -> keys can be Immutables (tuples,strings)
     -> values can be a object
        
     ->> if we give keys to mutable ,we get unhashable tpe error

     -> we cannot use list as key inn dictionaries
     -> we cannot use list as a set element element

     -> 90% of the timme keys will be strings





     -> Sets

-> In python, Sets are built in data structure that allows to store multiple 
    values in a single variable using { } (curly braces)

-> In sets we don't have keys like Dictionaries, only values

    -> dict = {1:10,2:20}
    -> set = {1,10,2,20} -> {10,20,1,2}

-> Set are UUU 

    -> U - Unique (No Duplicates, Duplicates will be removed)
    -> U - Unorderd (Insertion Order Not Preserved)
    -> U - Unindexed (No Index, So NO INDEXING & NO SLICING)

    -> SETS - used to perform Set related mathematical operations

    -> Union
    -> Intersection
    -> Difference 
    -> Symmetric Difference


9th Aug
=========

-> Set operations

-> Sets have 17 methods 

-> FrozenSet

    -> Regular Set is Mutable (Can be Changed)
    -> FrozenSet is Immutable (Cannot be Changed)

    -> FrozenSets only support set specific operations


-> Key Characteristics of Sets

    -> UnOrdered - Items are not stored in order, and order is not preserved

    -> MUTABLE - You can change data

    -> Duplicates - Not Allowed         

    -> NOTE - When you need Uniqueness in data go for sets

    NOTE- IMMUTABLE version of set is FROZENSET use frozenset class


-> Database operations

    -> CRUD - Create / Read / Update / Delete 

        -> In future w.r.t Databases you can perform them using Web Applications

        -> Now we are going to use Console Based Programs to achieve same

    -> LMS (Student - Trainer - Course - etc)   

        -> We want all our data structures to be implemented using LMS Applications

            -> Lists - Scores
            -> Tuples - ?
            -> Dictionaries - student 
            -> Sets - Skills

        -> Student (ID,Name,Scores,Skills)



        12 Aug 2025

  ==> Data structure

   16th aug 2025
   =============


   ==> Functional Based Programming
       -> function  - Function is a block of code which perform some tasks or actions or applications.

       -> functions can help break down complex problems into simpler and mallwe manageble tasks
        
        -> you can call a function,multiple times which avoids code repetition
        and helps you get code reusability

        -> function syntax
            def function_name():
            statements

        -> function with parameters
           -> This approach allows your function to take dynamic inputs  
        ->Based on arguments passes,we have different typess of functions
          1.positional arguments
          2.default arguments
          3.keyword arguments
          4.arbitary positional arguments  (*args)
          5.arbitrary keyword arguments    (**kwargs) 

       1.positional arguments --> the passed argument to the function,should have exact order defind in function signature
         
          -> here positions will change fuctionality,if incorrectly used
       2. default arguments
           -> passing default values as a arguments to the function
        -> default values will be overridden by values passed at the function call
        -> once start adding a default argument ,the next preceeding values should be default only not other types
 


      3.keyword arguments
        ->arguments are passed by expplicitly specifying the name ,so function call is based on the name of the argument
        -> order doesn't matter any more.

        ->improves code readuability and avoids confusion,when multiple parameters.

       4.arbitary [random or unknown] positional arguments  (*args)  

        -> these function will accept any number of positions based on the argument

        -> all values will be collected into tuple

       5.arbitrary keyword arguments    (**kwargs) 

         -->  These functions will accept any number of keywords based argumnents 

         --> All values will be collected into a dictionary.
