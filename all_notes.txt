--> what is python ?
   -> it is high level language
   -> scripting language
   ->object-oriented language

->language?
   -> -> Communication (Words, Writing, Speech, Gestures etc)  

            -> Regions(South India - North India - East Of India) (Culture)

                -> Hindi, Telugu etc
            
    -> Programming Language ?

        -> Machines cannot understand Languages like English, Hindi etc

        -> Machines know only Binary Language (011101111)

        -> User will Communicate with a computer using Programming Language

    ->  A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize 
        and structure the implementation of a computer program. 
            -> Imperative, Declarative, Object-Oriented, Functional etc
    
    -> NOTE: Python is a multi paradigm Programming Language 

    -> Imperative - How To do a task  (Python, Java, C etc)  

    -> Declarative - What To do (SQL, CSS, Python etc)  

    -> Functional - Everything is functions(Haskell, Lisp, Python etc)

        -> Lambda Expressions, Higher Order Functions etc
    
    -> Object Oriented - Taking real world objects and represent them in programs

    -> Scripting -  A scripting language is a programming language 
        designed to automate tasks (DevOps & Cloud)

        String brandName = "The Indian Garage Co";
        double ratings = 4.2;
        int size = 34;

        brand_name = "The Indian Garage Co"
        ratings = 4.2
        size = 34

        print(f"Brand is {brand_name}")

        NOTE: Applied On Object Level
    
    -> Java vs Python

        -> Java is Fast (Compiled Language) 

        -> Python is Slow (Interpreted Language) (Line By Line)

17th July
=========

    -> Setup Python Environment

        -> Setup Python Interpreter (Run Python Code)    

        -> IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - VS CODE

        -> Git Bash (Version Controlling) (Tracking Source Code) (Client Software)

        -> Setup GitHub Account (Store Code) (Service Provider)   

        19th July

        -> There are two modes to execute program of python
        ->Script mode
                       ->IDE
        -> interactive mode or commond mode
                  ->Python Interpreter


      -> Keyword
         -> it is predefined reserved words   ex-async,break etc   

       -> variables

           ->to store data     


        -> datatype
            ->to store different types of data.there aredifferent types of datatypes


       ->sort of variables we create ,we have rules

       ->Identifiers
          -> can letters(a-z)
          ->numbers
          ->Underscore

         ->Must start with
            ->alphabets
            ->Underscore
         ->cannot start with digit
         ->cannot be a phython Keyword           

       -> we use type() to know what type of data
       -> we use id() to know the addres sof the data  




         24/07/25

  =>Control statements


  ==> conditioal statements
  => conditional statements with output a boolean value is based  on conditional declaration.



  Indentation rules
      => use either space or tabes,but not both(python recommends 4 spaces)

      => make sure all the lines same block,have same indention level

      => input() = predefined function in python that interacts with the user.



    =>    type conversion
        -> it converts one datatype to another datatype
        ->> converting smaller datatype to lager datatype is considered as ssafe operation (Or) ["widening"]
        ->> its automatically handled by python.



        -> converting larger data type to samller datatype is called typecasting.
        ->it is handled by the developer

        -> int() ----> float() etc


        -> ternary operator/ conduional operator





  




     => if
          = > executes when if is true condition
     ,ifelse
     allows to check one or two conditions
     ,elif
     it allows to check multipleconditions statements,
     => matched case(3.1+1)


     => Nested condition = > inside a condition we can write the same condition.



     26/07/25
      -> Loops - Execute a block of code repeatedly, based on
        a condition

        -> When you want to repeat a task you rely on loops

        -> Types Of Loops 

            -> while loop - runs a block of code, as long as 
                the condition is True

            -> for loop - used to Iterate over a sequence
                (strings, lists, tuples etc) 

                -> you can use for loop when you know number
                    of Iterations before hand
            
            -> Nested Loops - Loop inside another loop

    -> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)         

        -> break - stop the execution of loop / terminate  the loop

        -> continue - used to skip the current Iteration

        -> pass - does nothing, used as a placeholder for future code



        =============
        -> variable = 10
        -> multiple values = 10 20 40 incorrect

        ->collection -sequence of data which 

        -> basic collection type is strings
        -> Advanced collection types
        ->lists
        ->tuples
        ->distonaries
        ->>sets

        -> strings



        -->python goes indexing for accessing individual characters.
             ->we have positive indexing(left to right)
             -> we have neagative indexing (right to left)

             0  1  2  3  4  5  (positive)
             p  y  t  h  o  n 
             -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 (negative)


             ->Accessing index out of range causes an error
                    IndexError: string index out of range
    -> Slicing -to access a range of characters inside the string 
       (range) => start,stop,Setup


       slicing - > start.stop,stepup




     -> Stringimmutability
        -> data once created can not be changed.
